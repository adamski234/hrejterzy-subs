# hrejterzy-subs
A community effort to make subtitles for videos of the HRejterzy YouTube channel

# Format
Currently I'm using SubRip files, synced to videos downloaded from YouTube with [`youtube-dl`](https://youtube-dl.org/).

# How to make subtitles
I use [GNOME subtitles](http://www.gnomesubtitles.org/), but the software isn't important. Download the video, open it in your editor and start writing. After you're done, just fork the repository, add the new file and send a pull request.

# Languages
Feel free to add any language you want, but I can't guarantee quality for languages other than English.

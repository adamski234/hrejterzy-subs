00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Hello?

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Good morning, Zdzisław Linux here
I'm calling from VaccinaTion

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,100
Sir, I don't want to sell you anything

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,300
I just wanted to ask, if you know that you will need to get vaccines every year?

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,500
No, I do not

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,900
Yeah, you will have to

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
A kind of a subscription if you will

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,800
We call it Vaccination as a Service

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,400
My God

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,200
Yup

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,000
And how does it work?

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,700
Well, there are different packages

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,600
There are Premium, Standard, Bangladesh and Community Edition packages

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,400
What's in the Premium?

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,200
Premium is a 6 in 1 vaccine

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,100
Pfizer.exe, rabies, tetanus, whooping cough, ingrown nails

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,000
And rabies

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,300
That's nice. I want one then.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,149
That'll be 8900zł. Do you want an invoice?

20
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:15,889
But you said you didn't want to sell me anything

21
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:17,489
Of course I don't want to sell

22
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:20,600
But maybe you want to buy

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,935
Do you maybe have something cheaper?

24
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,901
Only the Bangladesh package is cheaper

25
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:31,754
It's just saliva with the pathogen and vitamin C pills

26
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:35,161
There's also the reimbursed by the government Community Edition

27
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,850
What's in the reimbursed one?

28
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:40,985
A jar with air from the mountains

29
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:45,804
From the upper parts or the lower?

30
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:53,840
Lower. Who'd ever go into the upper regions?
So many traffic jams are there

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,819
There's only one slow ski lift

32
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:59,639
300zł for the ticket, massive queues

33
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:04,159
You can't even ski there, people stand in the mud

34
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:08,624
I bought a ski tour, but, damn it, I'm not even skiing

35
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:10,952
You know, I stay at home and call people

36
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:22,990
Alright, alright, I'll get the Premium for that 9k, thank you

37
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:37,083
Maybe I'll keep the underwear

00:00:00,415 --> 00:00:02,000
God damn

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,169
Yesterday I was analyzing data until 3AM

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,906
I went through all the price comparison websites,

4
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:08,252
all the available opinions,

5
00:00:08,253 --> 00:00:11,297
and like 30 reviews and unboxings on YouTube

6
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:12,072
And what do I get?

7
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:13,717
I still don't know which to pick

8
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:16,124
The first one is cheaper and seems to make sense

9
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:18,920
But, people said that the lifetime leaves a bit to be desired

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,672
On the other hand, the second one has the best reviews,

11
00:00:20,673 --> 00:00:22,118
is a bit faster,

12
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:23,604
but it's simultaneously...

13
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:25,322
more expensive

14
00:00:25,323 --> 00:00:27,605
But do I need a faster one at all?

15
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:28,678
From what I've seen on the graphs,

16
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,524
the speed gain is only an illusion

17
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:34,925
It might not even be noticeable in my case

18
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:37,150
So, I'll pick the cheaper one because, well...

19
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,317
it is cheaper.

20
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:41,144
Or maybe not, I'll pick the more expensive one,

21
00:00:41,144 --> 00:00:44,986
because an SD card has to be high quality

22
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:46,034
Yeah!

23
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:47,505
I'm picking the more expensive one

24
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,206
For...

25
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:51,162
17 PLN

26
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:51,945
Oooh!

27
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,506
You can buy it in installments?!

28
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,237
But hold on

29
00:00:55,237 --> 00:00:58,232
17 PLN in installments?

30
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:00,775
Like, damn

31
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:05,145
maybe I'd even take the installments

32
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:06,963
The fuck do I actually need the card for?

33
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:08,715
I have like 10 identical ones

34
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:15,840
No, no, I definitely have to buy that card

35
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,572
The old ones will definitely break

36
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:20,573
So, I'm buying

37
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,663
Yeah, let's go!

38
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:27,752
What?

39
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:30,351
12 PLN for shipping?

40
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:31,009
Oh!

41
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,483
I can pick it up for free at the store

42
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:34,746
in Giżycko

43
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,282
Meh, I'll drive

44
00:01:36,282 --> 00:01:38,283
Or maybe I shouldn't?

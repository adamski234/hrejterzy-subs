1
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,300
This is amazing

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,900
Hard to describe

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,500
It is as if a billion needles stabbed your body

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,100
At first, you don't want it

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,700
You want to back out of it

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,600
And then you are taken by that amazing feeling

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,700
That's better than

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,000
Than anything else that happened in my life

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,600
I would not replace it with, I don't know

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,500
With an intoxicating night with Kim Basinger

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,100
The one that played that alien in that one movie with that other guy, who played with that other movie

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
With Aykroyd

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,500
<i>With Ibisz?</i>

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,700
With Ibisz

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh fuck, what nice fractals

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,700
Ya

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,100
Definitely

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,700
That is my passion

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,700
Nothing will change that

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,500
I think about it all the time

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,400
And, heh, I think that's the reason to live

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,800
Linuxing

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,400
It is an amazing hobby, taken up by more and more people

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,000
Thousands of distros, consoles, CLIs, and high speeds

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,600
Give a feeling of joy, uniqueness and, primarily, freedom

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,600
Linux is the only system that adjusts precisely to the needs of the user

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,400
And even allows you to sometimes poke your hands around the kernel
(kernel can mean testicle in Polish)

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Supposedly you can do everything on it

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,800
Faster, better, and often entirely free of charge

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,000
The question is, can you run Office on it?

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,400
<i>There is OpenOffice. It's the same thing</i>

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
It's something else, though

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
<i>The same</i>

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,600
What about AutoCAD?

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,200
<i>Go away</i>

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,500
And Photoshop?

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
<i>Assshop</i>

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,600
And Adobe Premiere Pro?

39
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,200
<i>Fuck off, ok?</i>

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Just asking, I am

41
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,900
<i>Fucking leave</i>

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
That's how the fuckers talk
